# eeg-classification-system
A MATLAB system to load EEG data, add a dummy signal, and then try to classify with a variety of feature selection methods. It is intended to work with BCI competition data (http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/). Feature selection methods include PCA, ADEN, ADENZ, GADEN, and GADENZ.
